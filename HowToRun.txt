1. I have imported the following:
    import json, sys, argparse, math
    import numpy as np
    from queue import QueueBFS
    from shapely.geometry import Polygon
2. Queue import QueueBFS is from the queue.py file 
3. To run do the following:
    Make sure to have the previous imports added and installed
    Type "python project2.py project2_desc.json --out project2_out.json" 
    replace project2_desc.json with the file youd like to input
    replace the project2_out.json with the filename you would like to save the result to
    then press enter
